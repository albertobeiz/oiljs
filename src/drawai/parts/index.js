// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// THE PART REGISTRY — the one place a part type is turned on.
//
// To add a new kind of part:
//   1. write src/parts/<yourpart>.js following the contract in
//      ARCHITECTURE.md (copy the nearest existing part as a base)
//   2. import it here
//   3. put it in PARTS, in DRAW ORDER: earlier entries are drawn
//      BEHIND later ones
//
// Nothing else in the codebase needs to change. The editor panel,
// the recipe, reroll/lock, the crowd and the animator all read this
// list.
