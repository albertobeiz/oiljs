// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ITEM REGISTRY — the one place a family of objects is turned on.
//
// To add a family:
//   1. write src/items/<yours>.js against the contract below
//   2. import it here
//   3. put it in FAMILIES
//
// Nothing else changes: the draft, the cards, the floor, the child's
// fist and the favour odds all read this list. It is the same
// mechanical job as adding a part.
//
// THE FAMILY CONTRACT
// -------------------
//   id      unique string, also the favour key
//   slot    'held' | 'offhand' | 'worn' | 'charm' | 'mutation' | 'floor'
//   kind    FLOOR ONLY: which of the three floor kinds it makes —
//           'light' | 'toy' | 'bed'. The hand (below) guarantees one
//           card of each, so a floor family that does not declare it
//           can never be dealt.
//   noun    the word in the item's name ('sword')
//   weight  base draft weight before favour
//
//   gen(rng, C)     → params. C = { rank, pow, wpick }. `pow` is the
//                     rank's power multiplier, already rolled — bake
//                     it into whatever the family wants scaled.
//   statsOf(P)      → { add:{}, mul:{} }   PURE. Same P, same numbers.
//   fxOf(P)         → { fear, sticky, throw, chill, lull, thrift, familiar }
//   patchOf(P)      → a recipe patch (mutation slot only)
//   objOf(P)        → { kind, wU, hU, flat, r, fuel, dur, play } (floor only)
//   adj(P)          → one adjective for the name
//   desc(P)         → one line of card copy in the game's own voice
//   draw(s, P, F)   → the art, in REF space, origin at the ANCHOR,
//                     up NEGATIVE. `F` is present only when drawing
//                     inside a character; pass it through to finish().
//
// The anchor is the GRIP for held/offhand, the HEAD CONTACT for worn,
// the BASE for standing floor things, and the CENTRE for flat things
// and charms.
